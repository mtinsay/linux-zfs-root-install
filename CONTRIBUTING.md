## üß™ AI Coding Experiment Notice

**This project is an experiment in AI-generated code development.** As such, I am **not accepting code contributions, pull requests, or code changes** from human contributors. The entire codebase was generated through AI-human collaboration as a learning experiment, and I want to maintain that integrity.

## What This Means

- **No Pull Requests**: Code-related pull requests will not be reviewed or merged
- **No Code Contributions**: I won't be accepting patches, fixes, or enhancements to the scripts
- **No Development Collaboration**: This is not a traditional open-source project seeking contributors

## What You Can Do Instead

### üç¥ Fork and Create Your Own Version
Since this is open source under GPLv3, you're absolutely free to:
- **Fork the repository** and create your own maintained version
- **Modify the code** to suit your specific needs
- **Distribute your improvements** under the same GPLv3 license
- **Build a community** around your fork if you wish

### üìù Non-Code Contributions Welcome
While I'm not accepting code changes, other contributions are appreciated:
- **Documentation improvements** (typos, clarity, examples)
- **Issue reports** with detailed bug descriptions
- **Feature suggestions** and use case discussions
- **Testing feedback** from real-world usage

**Note on Translations**: Rather than accepting human translations, I may (with no commitment) consider adding documentation in other languages using AI/LLM translations to maintain the AI-generated nature of the project.

### üí¨ Community Engagement
- **Share your experiences** using the scripts
- **Discuss improvements** in GitHub Discussions
- **Help other users** with questions and issues
- **Write blog posts** about your ZFS installation experiences

## Why This Approach?

This project serves as a demonstration of what's possible with AI-assisted development. By maintaining the AI-generated nature of the code, it preserves the experimental value and showcases the capabilities and limitations of current AI coding tools.

## If You Want to Contribute Code

**Create your own fork!** The GPLv3 license ensures that:
- You can freely modify and distribute the code
- Your improvements must also be open source
- The community benefits from your enhancements
- You can build the project in the direction you envision

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Review README.md, DESIGN.md, and SPECS.md
- **Issues**: Search existing issues for similar problems  
- **Discussions**: Use GitHub Discussions for questions and ideas
- **Community**: Connect with other users who may have forked the project

## Final Thoughts

This approach might seem unconventional, but it serves the specific purpose of this experiment. I encourage you to take this code, improve it, and make it your own. The open source license ensures that the community can benefit from and build upon this work, even without traditional contribution workflows.

Thank you for understanding and for your interest in this AI coding experiment!
