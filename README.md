## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Download the scripts
git clone https://github.com/username/ubuntu-zfs-root.git
cd ubuntu-zfs-root

# 2. Configure your installation
cp ubuntu-config.sh ubuntu-config-local.sh
nano ubuntu-config-local.sh  # Edit configuration

# 3. Run the installation
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh
```

## ⚠️ WARNING
These scripts will **DESTROY ALL DATA** on the target disk. Use only on systems where you can afford to lose all data.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 22.04 Live USB/CD
- Target system booted from live media
- Internet connection
- At least 8GB RAM recommended
- UEFI system (Legacy BIOS not supported)

### Manual Partitioning Requirements
If using `PARTITION_MODE="manual"`, ensure your partitions meet these requirements:

- **EFI Partition**: At least 512MB, type EF00 (can be existing/shared)
- **Boot Partition**: Unformatted, at least 1GB, type 8300 (ext4)
- **Root Partition**: Unformatted, remaining space, type BF00 (ZFS will format)
- **Swap Partition** (optional): Can be any size, type 8200

**IMPORTANT**: EFI and Boot partitions MUST be on the same drive for proper GRUB installation.

**EFI Partition Handling**:
- **Existing EFI**: If partition contains EFI files, it will be preserved (dual-boot friendly)
- **Empty EFI**: If formatted but empty, it will be reformatted
- **Unformatted**: Will be formatted as FAT32

Example partitioning with `gdisk`:
```bash
# Create partitions (adjust sizes as needed)
sudo gdisk /dev/sda
# n, 1, default, +512M, EF00    (EFI - can reuse existing)
# n, 2, default, +1G, 8300      (Boot partition - ext4)
# n, 3, default, +2G, 8200      (Swap - optional)
# n, 4, default, default, BF00  (Root pool)
# w (write and exit)
```

### ZFS Dataset Structure

The installation creates a hierarchical dataset structure:

```
rpool/                          # Pool root
└── ROOT/                       # Root dataset (configurable, mounted as /)
    ├── home/                   # User data
    │   ├── root                # Root user home
    │   └── username            # Regular user home
    ├── var/                    # Variable data
    │   ├── log                 # System logs
    │   ├── cache               # Cache data
    │   └── ...                 # Other var datasets
    ├── usr/                    # User programs
    ├── opt/                    # Optional software
    ├── srv/                    # Service data
    └── swap                    # ZFS swap (if configured)
```

**Customizable Root Dataset**:
- `ROOT_DATASET_NAME`: Root dataset name (default: "ROOT")
- All other datasets are created under this root dataset

**Examples**:
```bash
ROOT_DATASET_NAME="SYSTEM"      # Creates rpool/SYSTEM/ (mounted as /)
ROOT_DATASET_NAME="OS"          # Creates rpool/OS/ (mounted as /)
ROOT_DATASET_NAME="ubuntu"      # Creates rpool/ubuntu/ (mounted as /)
```

### ZFS Mount Methods

**fstab Method (Recommended)**:
- Creates `/etc/fstab` entries for each ZFS dataset
- Uses systemd's native mounting capabilities
- Better integration with system services
- Easier troubleshooting and manual mounting

**ZFS Native Method**:
- Uses `zfs mount -a` command via systemd service
- Relies on ZFS's built-in mounting logic
- May be faster for large numbers of datasets
- Uses ZFS mount order dependencies

### ZFS Dataset Configuration Format

Dataset configuration uses the format: `"name:mountpoint:options"`

- **name**: Dataset name relative to pool (e.g., "var/log")
- **mountpoint**: Mount point (used for fstab entry, not ZFS mountpoint property)
- **options**: ZFS properties (optional, comma-separated)

**Important**: 
- All datasets automatically use `mountpoint=legacy` and are mounted via `/etc/fstab`
- Any `mountpoint=` options in the configuration are ignored since `mountpoint=legacy` is forced

Examples:
```bash
"home:/home:"                              # Home directory
"var/log:/var/log:"                       # System logs  
"data:/data:compression=lz4"               # Custom dataset with compression
"backup:/backup:quota=100G"                # Dataset with quota
```

### ZFS Pool Reuse Use Cases
The pool reuse feature is useful for:

- **System reinstallation**: Keep your data while reinstalling the OS
- **Dual-boot setups**: Share ZFS pools between different Ubuntu installations
- **Recovery scenarios**: Reinstall system on existing ZFS infrastructure
- **Upgrade scenarios**: Fresh install while preserving user data
- **New installations**: If `REUSE_ROOT_POOL="true"` but pool doesn't exist, creates new pool automatically

### Network and APT Configuration
The installation preserves your live system configuration:

**Network Configuration**:
- Copies all files from `/etc/netplan/` to the installed system
- Preserves your current network setup (WiFi, static IPs, etc.)
- No need to reconfigure networking after installation

**APT Sources**:
- Comments out default `sources.list` entries from debootstrap
- Copies all files from `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` to installed system
- Preserves PPAs, custom repositories, and authentication keys
- Maintains your current package source configuration

### Dual-Boot Support
The installation scripts are designed to work with existing systems:

- **EFI Partition**: Automatically detects and preserves existing EFI files
- **Shared EFI**: Can safely share EFI partition with Windows or other Linux distributions
- **Boot Chain**: GRUB will be installed alongside existing bootloaders
- **ZFS Pools**: Can coexist with other filesystems on the same disk

### Pool Import Behavior
The script automatically handles pool importing:

- **Automatic detection**: Finds pools whether imported or not
- **Safe import**: Uses `-N` flag to prevent automatic mounting during detection
- **Force import**: Uses `-f` flag when importing for reuse (handles dirty pools)
- **Interactive fallback**: Prompts user if unimported pool found during new installation

**Important Notes:**
- Pool names in config must match existing pool names exactly
- Existing datasets are preserved; only missing datasets are created
- Use `EXISTING_ROOT_DATASET` to specify a particular dataset as the new root
- Script handles both imported and unimported existing pools
- Always backup important data before running the installation

## Configuration

Before running, edit the configuration variables in `ubuntu-config.sh`. The script supports two partitioning modes:

### Auto Partitioning Mode (Default)
The script will automatically partition the specified disk:

```bash
PARTITION_MODE="auto"
DISK="/dev/sda"        # WARNING: All data will be destroyed!
EFI_SIZE="512M"
BOOT_SIZE="1G"
```

**Important**: In auto mode, all existing ZFS pools on the target disk are destroyed. `REUSE_ROOT_POOL` and `EXISTING_ROOT_DATASET` settings are ignored.

### Manual Partitioning Mode
Use existing partitions (useful for dual-boot or custom layouts):

```bash
PARTITION_MODE="manual"
EFI_PARTITION="/dev/sda1"    # Existing EFI System Partition
BOOT_PARTITION="/dev/sda2"   # Boot partition (ext4)
ROOT_PARTITION="/dev/sda3"   # Partition for ZFS root pool
SWAP_PARTITION="/dev/sda4"   # Optional: existing swap partition
```

### ZFS Pool Reuse (Manual Mode Only)
Reuse existing ZFS root pool instead of creating new one:

```bash
# ZFS pool reuse options (only works in manual mode)
REUSE_ROOT_POOL="true"      # Reuse existing root pool
EXISTING_ROOT_DATASET=""    # Optional: specific dataset to use as root
                           # e.g., "rpool/ROOT" or "rpool/SYSTEM"
```

**Note**: Pool reuse only works in `PARTITION_MODE="manual"`. Auto mode destroys all existing pools on the target disk.

### ZFS Dataset Configuration
All datasets are configured in a single array:

```bash
# ZFS Dataset Configuration
# Format: "dataset_name:mountpoint:options"
ZFS_DATASETS=(
    # Home datasets
    "home:/home:"
    "home/root:/root:"
    
    # Var datasets
    "var:/var:"
    "var/lib:/var/lib:"
    "var/log:/var/log:"
    "var/cache:/var/cache:"
    
    # Add custom datasets as needed
    "data:/data:compression=lz4,quota=100G"
    # "backup:/backup:quota=50G"
)
```

**Important**: 
- All datasets automatically use `mountpoint=legacy` and are mounted via `/etc/fstab` at boot time
- Any `mountpoint=` options in the configuration are ignored since `mountpoint=legacy` is forced

### Package Configuration
Customize which additional packages are installed:

```bash
# Additional packages to install during stage2
ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=(
    "ubuntu-minimal"
    "ubuntu-standard"
    "ubuntu-server"
    "cinnamon-desktop-environment"
    "hollywood"
    "sanoid"
)
```

**Customization**:
- Add or remove packages as needed
- Use empty array `ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=()` to skip additional packages
- Include metapackages like `ubuntu-desktop-minimal` for GUI systems

### Ubuntu Release Configuration
Choose the Ubuntu release to install:

```bash
DEBOOTSTRAP_SUITE="noble"       # Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (default)
# DEBOOTSTRAP_SUITE="jammy"     # Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
# DEBOOTSTRAP_SUITE="focal"     # Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
# DEBOOTSTRAP_SUITE="mantic"    # Ubuntu 23.10
```

**Supported releases**: Any Ubuntu release supported by debootstrap
**LTS releases**: Recommended for production use (focal, jammy, noble)

### Installation Root Configuration
Customize where the system is installed during setup:

```bash
INSTALL_ROOT="/mnt"             # Standard installation root
# INSTALL_ROOT="/target"        # Alternative installation root
```

### Installation Mode Configuration
Choose between automatic and manual installation:

```bash
AUTO_RUN_STAGE2="true"          # Automatic: Stage1 runs Stage2 automatically
# AUTO_RUN_STAGE2="false"       # Manual: Run each stage separately
```

**Automatic Mode** (Recommended):
- Single command installation
- Stage1 automatically executes Stage2 and Stage3
- Complete hands-off installation
- Faster and less error-prone
- Best for most users

**Manual Mode** (Advanced):
- Step-by-step control
- Ability to inspect and modify between stages
- Useful for debugging or customization
- Requires more user interaction

### ZFS Mount Configuration
Choose how ZFS datasets are mounted at boot:

```bash
# Mount method: "fstab" or "zfs"
ZFS_MOUNT_METHOD="fstab"    # Use /etc/fstab entries (recommended)
# ZFS_MOUNT_METHOD="zfs"    # Use ZFS native mounting
```

**fstab method**: Creates entries in `/etc/fstab` for each dataset, mounted by systemd
**zfs method**: Uses `zfs mount -a` command via systemd service

### Common Configuration
```bash
# System configuration
HOSTNAME="ubuntu-zfs"
USERNAME="user"

# Installation configuration
DEBOOTSTRAP_SUITE="noble"       # Ubuntu release (noble=24.04, jammy=22.04, etc.)
INSTALL_ROOT="/mnt"             # Root mountpoint for installation
AUTO_RUN_STAGE2="true"          # Automatically run stage2 after stage1

# ZFS configuration
POOL_NAME="rpool"               # Must match existing pool name if reusing
ROOT_DATASET_NAME="ROOT"        # Root dataset name - all datasets created under this

# Network and locale
NETWORK_INTERFACE="enp0s3"
TIMEZONE="UTC"
LOCALE="en_US.UTF-8"

# Swap (only used if SWAP_PARTITION is empty)
SWAP_SIZE="4G"  # Set to 0 to disable swap entirely

# Color customization (optional)
RED='\033[0;31m'     # Error messages
GREEN='\033[0;32m'   # Info messages  
YELLOW='\033[1;33m'  # Warning messages
```

## Installation Steps

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)
Boot your system from Ubuntu live USB/CD and run:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x ubuntu-*.sh

# Edit configuration (IMPORTANT!)
nano ubuntu-config.sh

# Run complete installation (all stages automatically)
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh

# Remove installation media and reboot when prompted
sudo reboot
```

### Manual Installation (Advanced)
For step-by-step control, disable automatic execution:
```bash
# In ubuntu-config.sh, set:
AUTO_RUN_STAGE2="false"

# Run Stage 1: Disk preparation and base system installation
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh

# Manually run Stage 2: System configuration
sudo chroot /mnt /usr/bin/env bash -l
./ubuntu-stage2.sh
exit

# Run Stage 3: Cleanup and prepare for reboot
sudo ./ubuntu-stage3.sh
sudo reboot
```

## What Each Stage Does

### Stage 1: ubuntu-stage1.sh (Main Script)
- **Disk Safety**: Unmounts all partitions and disables swap before disk operations
- Installs ZFS packages
- Partitions the target disk (EFI + Boot + Root + optional Swap)
- Creates ZFS root pool with `devices=on` property for proper root filesystem operation
- Formats boot partition as ext4 with "boot" label, EFI partition as FAT32 with "EFI" label
- Creates ZFS datasets with optimized settings
- Installs base Ubuntu system via debootstrap
- **Enhanced fstab**: Uses `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` references for boot and EFI partitions
- **Secure chroot setup**: Copies apt cache, creates reliable DNS configuration, no EFI variable access
- **In automatic mode**: Executes Stage 2 and Stage 3 automatically

### Stage 2: ubuntu-stage2.sh (System Configuration)
- Configures locale and timezone (sets hardware clock to local time)
- **Non-interactive package configuration**: Uses `dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive` for keyboard and console setup
- Installs complete GRUB EFI package set: `grub-efi-amd64`, `grub-efi-amd64-signed`, `shim-signed`
- Installs and configures GRUB bootloader (preserves existing GRUB settings)
- Sets up ZFS services
- Creates user accounts with configurable groups
- Installs configurable additional packages

### Stage 3: ubuntu-stage3.sh (Cleanup)
- **Enhanced mount cleanup**: Uses comprehensive approach to unmount all non-ZFS mounts under `/mnt`
- Exports ZFS pools
- Prepares system for reboot

## Post-Installation

After successful boot into your new ZFS system:

### Create Snapshots
```bash
# Create a snapshot
sudo zfs snapshot rpool/ROOT/ubuntu@$(date +%Y%m%d)

# List snapshots
zfs list -t snapshot
```

### Monitor ZFS Health
```bash
# Check pool status
zpool status

# Run scrub (data integrity check)
sudo zpool scrub rpool

# Check scrub progress
zpool status rpool
```

### ZFS Features
- **Compression**: Enabled (zstd for root filesystem)
- **Snapshots**: Easy system state capture
- **Auto-trim**: Enabled for SSD optimization
- **Datasets**: Organized structure for different mount points
- **Boot**: Traditional ext4 for maximum compatibility
- **Legacy Mounting**: All datasets automatically use `mountpoint=legacy` and mount via `/etc/fstab` at boot

## Troubleshooting

### Boot Issues
- Check GRUB configuration: `/etc/default/grub`
- Verify ZFS bootfs: `zpool get bootfs rpool`
- Update GRUB: `sudo update-grub`

### ZFS Issues
- Import pools manually: `sudo zpool import -f rpool`
- Check ZFS services: `systemctl status zfs.target`
- List available pools: `sudo zpool import`

### Recovery
Boot from live media and import pools:
```bash
sudo zpool import -f rpool
sudo mount -t zfs rpool/ROOT /mnt  # Use your INSTALL_ROOT value
sudo chroot /mnt /bin/bash
```

### ZFS Pool Import Issues
- **Pool not found**: Check `sudo zpool import` to see available pools
- **Pool busy**: Another system may be using the pool, use `-f` to force import
- **Dirty pool**: Pool wasn't cleanly exported, script uses `-f` automatically
- **Permission denied**: Ensure running as root and devices are accessible
- **Dataset conflicts**: Use `EXISTING_ROOT_DATASET` to specify exact dataset
- **Import failures**: 
  ```bash
  # Manual import with force
  sudo zpool import -f -R /mnt <pool_name>
  
  # Check pool status
  sudo zpool status <pool_name>
  
  # Clear errors if needed
  sudo zpool clear <pool_name>
  ```

### EFI Partition Issues
- **EFI not detected**: Check partition type with `sudo gdisk -l /dev/sdX`
- **Mount failures**: Verify partition is not corrupted with `sudo fsck.fat /dev/sdX1`
- **Dual-boot problems**: Ensure EFI partition is large enough (512MB minimum)
- **Manual EFI setup**:
  ```bash
  # Check EFI partition contents
  sudo mkdir -p /tmp/efi && sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /tmp/efi
  sudo ls -la /tmp/efi/EFI/
  sudo umount /tmp/efi
  
  # Force reformat if needed (WARNING: destroys existing bootloaders)
  sudo mkfs.fat -F32 -n EFI /dev/sdX1
  ```

## Customization

### Dataset Customization
You can easily customize the ZFS dataset layout by editing the `ZFS_DATASETS` array in `config.sh`:

- **Change root dataset name**: Modify `ROOT_DATASET_NAME`
- **Add custom datasets**: Add new entries to the `ZFS_DATASETS` array
- **Remove unwanted datasets**: Comment out or delete array entries
- **Change mount points**: Modify the mountpoint field (second field)
- **Add ZFS properties**: Use the options field (third field) for compression, quotas, etc.

Example custom configurations:
```bash
# Custom root dataset name
ROOT_DATASET_NAME="SYSTEM"      # Creates rpool/SYSTEM/ as root filesystem

# Minimal installation
ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=(
    "ubuntu-minimal"
)

# Server environment
ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=(
    "ubuntu-minimal"
    "ubuntu-standard"
    "ubuntu-server"
)

# Desktop environment (default)
ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=(
    "ubuntu-minimal"
    "ubuntu-standard"
    "ubuntu-server"
    "cinnamon-desktop-environment"
    "hollywood"
    "sanoid"
)

# Development environment
ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=(
    "ubuntu-minimal"
    "ubuntu-standard"
    "ubuntu-server"
    "build-essential"
    "git"
    "python3-pip"
    "nodejs"
    "docker.io"
    "code"
)
```

### Other Customizations
You can also modify the scripts to:
- Adjust compression algorithms
- Add additional packages
- Configure different partitioning schemes
- Set up RAID configurations

# Recent Enhancements

### Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging

All Ubuntu stage scripts now include comprehensive error handling and debugging capabilities:

**Enhanced Bash Options**:
```bash
set -Euo pipefail
```
- **`-E`**: ERR trap inheritance by functions and subshells
- **`-u`**: Treat unset variables as errors
- **`-o pipefail`**: Pipeline fails if any command fails

**Debug Tracing**:
- **Automatic activation**: Enable with `DEBUG="true"` in `ubuntu-config.sh`
- **Command line override**: Use `-D` or `--debug` parameter
- **Command visibility**: Shows every executed command when enabled
- **Proper timing**: Debug tracing starts after config and parameter processing

**Debug Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Enable debug via config file
# In ubuntu-config.sh: DEBUG="true"
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh

# Enable debug via command line
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh -D

# Combined with other options
sudo ./ubuntu-stage1.sh -y -D  # Auto-confirm + debug
```

### Enhanced Security and Reliability

**Symlink-Safe resolv.conf Handling**:
- Detects both regular files and symlinks
- Backs up existing configuration before replacement
- Creates reliable DNS configuration for chroot environment

**Improved Command Execution**:
- Uses `eval` for complex command strings to handle paths with spaces
- Proper quoting and argument handling throughout scripts
- Enhanced error reporting with line numbers and failed commands

**Comprehensive Mount Cleanup**:
- Automatically detects and unmounts all non-ZFS mounts under `/mnt`
- Uses reverse order unmounting for proper dependency handling
- Lazy force unmount for stubborn filesystems

### Enhanced fstab Management

**UUID Reference Format**:
```bash
# Boot partition
/dev/disk/by-uuid/12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 /boot ext4 defaults 0 2

# EFI partition
/dev/disk/by-uuid/ABCD-EFGH /boot/efi vfat umask=0077 0 1
```

**Benefits**:
- More explicit than `UUID=` shorthand
- Better debugging and verification capabilities
- Universal compatibility with Linux tools

### ZFS Root Dataset Optimization

**Device Access Configuration**:
```bash
zfs create -o mountpoint=/ -o canmount=on -o devices=on $POOL_NAME/$ROOT_DATASET_NAME
```

**Essential for Root Filesystem**:
- Enables device file access (`/dev/null`, `/dev/zero`, etc.)
- Prevents boot-time device access issues
- Required for proper system operation

### Advanced Disk Safety

**Comprehensive Partition Management**:
- Automatically unmounts all partitions before disk operations
- Disables swap partitions on target disk
- Uses lazy unmount for busy filesystems
- Prevents "device is busy" errors during installation

**Enhanced Package Management**:
- Non-interactive configuration with `dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive`
- Complete GRUB EFI package installation for Secure Boot support
- Eliminated duplicate package configuration calls#
## Optimized Partition and Swap Handling

**Reorganized Disk Setup Process**:
The installation process now follows a logical sequence for optimal reliability:

1. **Create partitions** - All partitions (EFI, boot, swap, root) created first
2. **Format partitions** - All formatting happens immediately after creation
3. **Generate fstab entries** - Uses correct UUIDs generated during formatting

**Enhanced Swap Management**:
- **Stage 1 handling**: Swap partition formatted during disk setup phase
- **Immediate UUID generation**: Swap UUID available for fstab creation
- **Consistent formatting**: Uses `mkswap -f` in auto mode, `mkswap` in manual mode
- **Proper fstab entries**: Uses `/dev/disk/by-uuid/` format for consistency

**Benefits**:
- **Correct UUID availability**: fstab entries always have valid UUIDs
- **Logical organization**: All disk operations happen together
- **Improved reliability**: No timing issues with UUID generation
- **Consistent format**: All partition entries use same UUID reference style### 
Latest System Integration Improvements

**Enhanced ZFS Dataset Management**:
- **Native ZFS mounting**: Uses `zfs mount` instead of manual mount commands for root datasets
- **Proper ZFS integration**: Leverages ZFS's built-in mounting capabilities with `canmount=on`
- **Consistent behavior**: All root dataset scenarios use the same ZFS-native approach

**Improved GRUB Configuration**:
- **Escaped ZFS paths**: Properly escapes forward slashes in `root=ZFS=` parameter
- **Reliable sed operations**: Prevents delimiter conflicts in GRUB configuration
- **Robust boot parameters**: Ensures correct ZFS root specification regardless of dataset names

**Enhanced System Configuration**:
- **Symlink-safe os-release handling**: Properly copies `/etc/os-release` whether it's a file or symlink
- **Content preservation**: Follows symlinks to copy actual file content
- **Modern system compatibility**: Works with distributions that use symlinked os-release files

**Optimized Execution Flow**:
- **Logical ZFS ordering**: ZFS pools and datasets created immediately after partitioning
- **Early chroot setup**: Chroot environment established right after dataset creation
- **Improved dependency management**: Each operation builds properly on previous steps### En
hanced Command Line Interface

**Extended Parameter Support**:
The installation script now supports additional command line parameters for greater flexibility:

```bash
# Basic usage
